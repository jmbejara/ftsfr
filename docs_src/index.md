# Financial Time Series Forecasting Repository (FTSFR)

**A standardized macro-finance data repository for global time series forecasting research**

## Overview

The Financial Time Series Forecasting Repository (FTSFR) addresses a critical gap in quantitative finance research: the lack of standardized datasets for evaluating and comparing time series forecasting models. When researchers evaluate their own forecasting models on their own arbitrarily chosen datasets, apples-to-apples comparisons across forecasting algorithms are not possible. This repository provides a comprehensive collection of financial and macroeconomic datasets that have been cleaned, formatted, and standardized according to academic best practices. We hope that this repository will serve as a useful time series forecasting benchmark.

## Why FTSFR?

### The Problem
When comparing different time series forecasting algorithms, researchers need **apples-to-apples comparisons**. Each forecasting model must be evaluated on identical datasets that have been:
- Prepared using the same methodology
- Cleaned with consistent standards  
- Sampled over the same time periods
- Formatted in the same way

We are inspired by the work of the Monash Time Series Data Repository (MTSDR), which provides a collection offreely available datasets for benchmarking  time series forecasting models. However, we are motivated by the desire to provide datasets from topics in finance and economics, which are often not freely available (e.g., require a subscription to access).

### Our Solution
We provide researchers with easy access to a ready-to-use repository of financial and macroeconomic datasets that have been cleaned, formatted, and standardized according to academic best practices. Although most of the data in this repository requires a subscription to access, we provide what we think is the next-best thing: a codebase that automates the end-to-end process for assembling various financial and macroeconomic data, from the data pull step to the final cleaning and transformation step. Most of our code pulls from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), which is a subscription-based service commonly available at most universities. Our quickstart guide provides a short and simple guide to get you started.

## Key Features

- üì° Streamlined data collection from multiple sources (e.g., WRDS, FRED, etc.)
- üéØ Academic Standards: Replicates cleaning procedures for each datasetfrom academic literature
- ü§ñ Fully reproducible data preparation workflows
- üìà Spans multiple financial domains:
    - Equity Markets: Returns, portfolios, and characteristics
    - Fixed Income: Treasury, corporate, and sovereign bonds
    - Credit Markets: CDS spreads and bond-CDS basis
    - Derivatives: Options and futures data
    - Foreign Exchange: Currency portfolios and rates
    - Commodities: Futures and spot prices
    - Banking: Call report data and bank-specific metrics

## Replications of Studies from Academic Literature

Each of the cleaned datasets that we provide follow the procedures outlined in a published academic paper. We feel that these benchmarks are most useful when they follow the same procedures commonly used in the literature. We replicate the procedures outlined in or use the data provided via the following papers:

## Data Sources

Our repository leverages both **publicly available** and **subscription-based** data sources:

### Public Data Sources *(No subscription required)*
- He, Kelly, Manela test portfolios
- Ken French Data Library  
- Federal Reserve economic data
- NYU Call Report archive
- Open Source Bond Asset Pricing

### Academic Subscription Sources *(Commonly available via university subscriptions)*
- WRDS Compustat North America
- WRDS CRSP (Stocks, Bonds, Treasury)
- WRDS Markit CDS data
- WRDS Bond Returns
- WRDS Mergent FISD
- WRDS Bank Premium
- Bloomberg Terminal

```{note}
While some datasets require paid subscriptions, they are commonly available through academic institutions. Our code automates the data retrieval process once you have the appropriate access credentials. If you don't have access to any of the above data sources, you can still use our code to pull from only the data sources that you have subscriptions for. The code will automatically skip the data sources that you don't have access to. However, in that case, you won't be able to assemble the full suite of benchmark datasets.
```
