# Financial Time Series Forecasting Repository (FTSFR)

**A standardized macro-finance data repository for global time series forecasting research**

## Overview

The Financial Time Series Forecasting Repository (FTSFR) addresses a critical gap in quantitative finance research: the lack of standardized datasets for evaluating and comparing time series forecasting models. This repository provides a comprehensive collection of financial and macroeconomic datasets that have been cleaned, formatted, and standardized according to academic best practices.

## Why FTSFR?

### The Problem
When comparing different time series forecasting algorithms, researchers need **apples-to-apples comparisons**. Each forecasting model must be evaluated on identical datasets that have been:
- Prepared using the same methodology
- Cleaned with consistent standards  
- Sampled over the same time periods
- Formatted in the same way

### Our Solution
FTSFR provides a codebase that automates the extract-transform-load (ETL) process for financial and macroeconomic data from various sources. Our standardized approach ensures that researchers can focus on model development rather than data preparation.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”§ **Automated ETL Pipeline**
- Streamlined data collection from multiple sources
- Consistent cleaning and formatting procedures
- Reproducible data preparation workflows

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Coverage**
Our repository spans multiple financial domains:
- **Equity Markets**: Returns, portfolios, and characteristics
- **Fixed Income**: Treasury, corporate, and sovereign bonds
- **Credit Markets**: CDS spreads and bond-CDS basis
- **Derivatives**: Options and futures data
- **Foreign Exchange**: Currency portfolios and rates
- **Commodities**: Futures and spot prices
- **Banking**: Call report data and bank-specific metrics

### ðŸŽ¯ **Academic Standards**
- Data cleaning follows established academic literature
- Consistent with peer-reviewed research methodologies
- Suitable for academic publication and peer review

### ðŸ“ˆ **Baseline Benchmarks**
- Pre-computed performance metrics for baseline forecasting methods
- Multiple error metrics for comprehensive evaluation
- Reference points for comparing new forecasting approaches

## Data Sources

Our repository leverages both **publicly available** and **subscription-based** data sources:

### Public Data Sources *(No subscription required)*
- He, Kelly, Manela test portfolios
- Ken French Data Library  
- Federal Reserve economic data
- NYU Call Report archive
- Open Source Bond Asset Pricing

### Academic Subscription Sources *(Commonly available via university subscriptions)*
- WRDS Compustat North America
- WRDS CRSP (Stocks, Bonds, Treasury)
- WRDS Markit CDS data
- WRDS Bond Returns
- WRDS Mergent FISD

```{note}
While some datasets require paid subscriptions, they are commonly available through academic institutions. Our code automates the data retrieval process once you have the appropriate access credentials.
```

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Follow our [quickstart guide](data_sources_and_modules.md#installation) to set up the environment
2. **Configuration**: Set up your data source credentials and specify available subscriptions
3. **Data Download**: Run the automated ETL pipeline to build your standardized datasets
4. **Benchmarking**: Use our baseline models to establish performance benchmarks
