    "\\Delta y = y_{\\text{bond}} - y_{\\text{Treasury-DM}},\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A small parallel shift $Z$ applied to all discount rates changes price by $-D_{\\text{mod}}\\;Z$.  For modest spreads, this produces nearly the same price change as replacing the spot curve with a single rate shift $\\Delta y$.  \n",
    "2. Duration-matching the Treasury benchmark neutralises curve-shape effects, so $\\Delta y$ isolates the average extra yield attributable to credit/liquidity risk.  \n",
    "3. Empirically, $\\Delta y$ tracks $Z$ closely for plain-vanilla, option-free bonds, making it a “good-enough” proxy when full spot-curve data or iterative Z-spread calculations are impractical.\n",
