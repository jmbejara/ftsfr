    "# CDS Par Spread Returns Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction is based upon the structure proposed by Siriwardane, Sunderam, and Wallen in Segmented Arbitrage (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3960980). The original paper studies the concept of implied arbitrage returns in many different markets. If markets were truly frictionless, we would expect there to be perfect correlation between all of the arbitrage returns. This is because efficient capital allocation would dictate that capital be spent where the best opportunity is, thus dictating the arbitrage opportunites we calculate via different product would have correlating rates as capital would be allocated to a different source if the arbitrage opportunity looks more attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CDS Par Spread Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spread Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we will walk through the steps to constructing the implied arbitrage found in the CDS and corporate bond market as specified in the Appendix of the paper (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e29e11bb83a3f5d75beb17d/t/654d74d916f20316049a0889/1699575002123/Appendix.pdf). The authors define the CDS basis ($CB$) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CB_{i, t, \\tau} = CDS_{i, t, \\tau} - FR_{i, t, \\tau}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $FR_{i, t, \\tau}$ = time $t$ floating rate spread implied by a fixed-rate corporate bond issued by firm $i$ at tenor $\\tau$\n",
    "- $CDS_{i, t, \\tau}$ = time $t$ Credit Default Swap (CDS) par spread for firm $i$ with tenor $\\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative basis implies an investor could earn a positive arbitrage profit by going long the bond and purchasing CDS protection. The investor would pay a lower par spread than the coupon of the bond itself and then receive value from the default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $FR$ is substituted by the paper with **Z-spread** which we also modify in our construction. We will go into the substitution in detail later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $CDS$ is interpolated by the authors using a cubic spline function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implied Risk Free Return\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the CDS spread from above, traditional construction of a risk free rate for implied arbitrage implied the following return.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "rfr^{CDS}_{i, t, \\tau} = y_{t, \\tau} - CB_{i , t, \\tau}\n",

    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y_{t, \\tau}$ = maturity matched treasury yield at time $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk free rate then can be seen as the treasury yield in addition to the basis recieved when executing the CDS basis trade (investor benefits from negative basis).\n",
