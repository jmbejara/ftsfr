\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a macro-finance data repository for benchmarking the
performance of global time series forecasting methods. A standardized benchmark
is crucial for comparing the performance of different forecasting methods, so as
to allow apples-to-apples comparisons across different forecasting methods and
to discourage cherry-picking of results. Despite the ubiquity of time series
forecasting methods in macroeconomics and finance, a standardized repository of
data for benchmarking in these domains does not exist. One reason for this is
that many of these datasets are available only through paid subscriptions and
are thus not freely distributable. To address this issue, we instead provide a
set of scripts that automate the download, data cleaning, and assembly of data
sets from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) platform and the Bloomberg
Terminal. Since many academic institutions have access to WRDS or a Bloomberg
Terminal, contingent on having access to the appropriate WRDS or Bloomberg
subscriptions, each researcher will be able to exactly reproduce each of the
datasets provided in this repository. Furthermore, the datasets that we provide
are cleaned and formatted in a way that is common within the corresponding
academic literature. Our aim is to facilitate the process of benchmarking global
times series forecasting methods on data from these domains. In this light, we
demonstrate the utility of our repository by showcasing the performance of
several baseline forecasting methods using a variety of error metrics, providing
baseline performance metrics which researchers can use to compare forecasting
approaches. We hope that this repository will enhance research
that increases the precision of financial and economic forecasts and contribute
to research related to promoting financial stability and supporting a
well-functioning economy.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% TODO: Write introduction emphasizing the critical need for standardized benchmarks in macro-finance
% - Establish that time series forecasting is ubiquitous and prevalent in macroeconomics and finance domains
% - Highlight the current gap: no existing standardized benchmarks for evaluating forecasting algorithms in macro-finance
% - Explain why apples-to-apples comparisons are impossible without standardized datasets
% - Stress that researchers currently evaluate their own models on arbitrarily chosen datasets, making comparisons meaningless
% - Position this work as filling a critical gap in quantitative finance research
% - Emphasize that this complements (not substitutes) the Monash benchmark
% - Make clear that the lack of standardization is particularly problematic in finance where data often requires subscriptions

\section{Literature Review and Related Work}
\label{sec:literature}

% TODO: Position the paper relative to existing benchmarks and establish the canonical nature of chosen cleaning methods
% - Review the Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive and explain how FTSFR follows their established template
% - Introduce He, Kelly, Manela (2017) as the anchor paper for asset class selection and cleaning methods
% - Introduce Siriwardane, Sunderam, & Wallen (2022) "Segmented Arbitrage" as the anchor for arbitrage spread construction
% - Emphasize that the choice to follow these papers is deliberate - not doing anything novel is a FEATURE, not a bug
% - Acknowledge that some dataset choices are somewhat ad hoc but are anchored by these survey-style papers

\subsection{Time Series Forecasting Benchmarks}
% Review of existing benchmarking archives

\subsection{Asset Pricing Literature}
% He, Kelly, Manela (2017) and their approach to asset class selection

\section{Asset Class Datasets}

Following \cite{He2017}, we include comprehensive datasets across multiple asset classes, each cleaned according to canonical methods from the academic literature.
