If you need to view the data available to you, please view the file [data_glimpses.md](mdc:docs_src/data_glimpses.md) . This file is periodically refreshed. You can refresh it yourself by making the following call `python ./src/create_data_glimpses.py`. This script goes through and finds all CSV and parquet files mentioned in [dodo.py](mdc:dodo.py) and describes what's in them.
