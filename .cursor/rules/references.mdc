When this rule is requested, I want you to read through the references in the _references directory. You can see which reference documents are in there by looking at [bibliography.bib](mdc:reports/bibliography.bib)

In the _references folder, I I've already used OCR to turn the PDFs into markdown files, so it's easier for you to read them.

When you are referencing any of these documents, you should be citing them. Please use [bibliography.bib](mdc:_references/bibliography.bib) to help create citations. Please try to use quotes from the documents.

Also, please use [paper_summaries.md](mdc:_output/paper_summaries/paper_summaries.md) as a reference to help you to see the big picture of what is available.
